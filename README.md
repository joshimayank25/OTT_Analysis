OTT Movie Recommendation System â€“ Project Summary
This project aims to build an intelligent movie recommendation system for OTT platforms, specifically designed for students and professionals transitioning into data analytics. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the system analyzes user preferences and behaviours to provide personalized movie suggestions, enhancing user satisfaction through genre-specific recommendations.

Key Components:
Data Collection: Utilize datasets from MovieLens, IMDb, or web scraping to gather movie metadata, user ratings, and watch history.
Recommendation Techniques: Implement collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models to enhance accuracy. Advanced deep-learning methods may also be explored.
Tech Stack: Python-based implementation using Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Flask/Streamlit for deployment.
Evaluation Metrics: Assess performance using RMSE, precision-recall, and hit rate to optimize recommendations.
Enhancements: Focus on personalization, real-time recommendations, and potential OTT platform integration for a practical, resume-worthy project.
 
 To run app.py
 We need to run pip install streamlit
 Then need to run python -m streamlit run app.py to launch the streamlit
